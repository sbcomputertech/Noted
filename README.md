Noted is a web application that provides a simple interface to add, edit and delete notes from a database.<br>
It can be ran locally, with all the data stored on your machine, or elsewhere on the network or even the wider internet, if you choose so.<br>
A Sqlite3 database is used for the advantage of running no additional services like a MySQL server.<br>
